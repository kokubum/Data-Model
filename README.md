# Data-Model
Implementation of some special methods of data models made in python 3, with some explanations about how to use, implement, and purpose.

Examples:

- \_\_new__
- \_\_call__
- \_\_init__
- \_\_del__
- \_\_getattr__
- \_\_getattribute__
- \_\_setattr__
- \_\_delattr__


## Getting Started

To run the scripts you only need to have python 3 in your machine, and call the following command:
```
python3 name_of_the_script.py
```

Pay attention that the "del_instance.py" can accept command line argument.
To see the behavior of the script deleting an instance before the program end:

```
python3 del_instance.py before
```
To see the behavior of the script deleting an instance in the end of the program (garbage collector):
```
python3 del_instance.py
```
